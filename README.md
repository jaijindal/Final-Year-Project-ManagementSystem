# SC2002-Project

The Final Year Project Management System is an application for students, supervisors and FYP coordinators to manage matters related to the registration of FYP projects. All in all, our application ensures that data related to FYP projects are well-managed between the different entities, thereby allowing the users to carry out their respective roles.

The team has taken the SOLID Design Principle approach in order to enhance the reusability of the application and make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.This project is designed as per the requirements of the SC2002 Object Oriented Programming Course Requirements.
